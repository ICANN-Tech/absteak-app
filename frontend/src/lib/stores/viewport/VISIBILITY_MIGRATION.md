# Visibility Store Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated all functions from the old `src/lib/stores/visibility.ts` to the new viewport visibility system in `src/lib/stores/viewport/visibility.ts`. The old visibility store has been removed and all components now use the unified viewport visibility system.

## Migrated Functions

### Legacy Compatibility Functions
The following functions have been added to the viewport visibility system to maintain backward compatibility:

1. **`getVisibilityStore(id: string | null = null): Writable<boolean>`**
   - Creates or returns a legacy visibility store for the given ID
   - Automatically syncs with the viewport system if the ID is a valid ComponentId
   - Maintains the same API as the old function

2. **`createVisibilityHandler(id: string | null = null)`**
   - Creates a visibility handler function that respects lock state
   - Works with both ComponentId and legacy string identifiers
   - Maintains the same behavior as the old function

3. **`createVisibilityToggle(id: string | null = null)`**
   - Creates a toggle function that respects lock state
   - Works with both ComponentId and legacy string identifiers
   - Maintains the same behavior as the old function

4. **`getAllVisibilityStores(): Map<string | null, Writable<boolean>>`**
   - Returns all legacy visibility stores
   - Maintains compatibility with existing code

5. **`getAllLockStates(): Map<string | null, { locked: boolean; lockedValue: boolean }>`**
   - Returns all lock states in the legacy format
   - Maintains compatibility with existing code

## Updated Files

### Modified Files
1. **`src/lib/stores/viewport/visibility.ts`**
   - Added legacy compatibility functions at the end of the file
   - Functions maintain the same API but use the new viewport system internally

2. **`src/lib/stores/index.ts`**
   - Removed export of old visibility store
   - Added explicit exports of legacy compatibility functions from viewport visibility

3. **`src/lib/stores/modal.ts`**
   - Updated import to use viewport visibility instead of old visibility store

### Removed Files
1. **`src/lib/stores/visibility.ts`** - Completely removed as all functions are now in the viewport system

## How It Works

### For ComponentId Identifiers
When a legacy function is called with a ComponentId (e.g., 'header', 'navigation'), the system:
1. Checks if a viewport component already exists for that ID
2. If not, creates a new trigger-based ViewportVisibilityManager
3. Syncs the legacy store with the viewport component's visibility state
4. Respects the viewport system's lock mechanisms

### For Non-ComponentId Identifiers
For legacy string identifiers that aren't ComponentIds:
1. Creates a standalone writable store
2. Uses a separate legacy lock map for lock/unlock functionality
3. Maintains the original behavior without viewport integration

### Lock System Integration
The legacy functions integrate with the viewport system's lock mechanism:
- `lockVisibility()` and `unlockVisibility()` work with both systems
- Lock state is respected by both legacy handlers and viewport components
- Seamless transition between old and new APIs

## Benefits

1. **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing components continue to work without modification
2. **Unified System**: Everything now uses the same underlying viewport visibility system
3. **Enhanced Features**: Legacy components can now benefit from viewport features like area-based detection
4. **Clean Architecture**: Single source of truth for all visibility management
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to migrate individual components to the new API when needed

## Migration Path for Components

Components can be gradually migrated from legacy API to new viewport API:

### Old Way (still works):
```typescript
import { getVisibilityStore, createVisibilityHandler } from '$lib/stores';
const isVisible = getVisibilityStore('header');
const handler = createVisibilityHandler('header');
```

### New Way (recommended for new components):
```typescript
import { createStateVisibility } from '$lib/stores/viewport/visibility';
const { visible, show, hide, toggle } = createStateVisibility('header');
```

## Testing

The migration has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Development server runs without errors
- ✅ All existing components continue to function
- ✅ Lock/unlock functionality works correctly
- ✅ Modal system integration works
- ✅ Demo components function properly

## Next Steps

1. **Gradual Migration**: Consider migrating individual components to use the new viewport API for enhanced features
2. **Documentation**: Update component documentation to reference the new system
3. **Cleanup**: Eventually remove legacy compatibility functions once all components are migrated
